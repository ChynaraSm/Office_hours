/*

    Create a class Workout
    define and encapsulate these instance variables:
        name, duration, calories burned

    create a constructor to initialize the variables. Call the setters in the constructor

    in the setters only set the values if they are valid data based on these requirements:
        name: should have only letters and spaces, no other characters type. The name cannot be empty either

        duration: should be more than 0

        calories burned: should be more than 0 and less than 1000
